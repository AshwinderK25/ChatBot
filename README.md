# ChatBot
To run the application:
1) go to project directory : ChatBot
2) run the command: python main.py
3) Hit 127.0.0.1:5000 in browser (Use Chrome, still need to work on css for other browsers)
4) Type 'hello','hi', 'hi there' in chat window just to test the data flow. I have hardcoded the reponses in 'handle_my_custom_event' in main.py
